# Paper Publication: Biomedical Image Segmentation Using SegAN Architecture

### Abstract

Cancer is termed as one of the deadliest disease and it is becoming a major health problem in the world. This deadly disease can be cured, if it is found at earlier stages. Medical imaging plays an important role in finding this type of diseases and help in treatment planning. Automated lesion/tumor segmentation is an important and challenging clinical diagnostic task because of tumor's different shape, volume, contrast and locations. Since deep learning is promising in many applications, thus motivating us to apply in this important task. In this paper, we propose to do automated tumor segmentation with two challenge dataset named as BraTs 2017 brain tumor and ISIC 2018 skin lesion by using Segmentor Adversarial Network (SegAN), inspired from classical GAN.

- Datasets: a) BraTS 2017 (Brain Tumor Dataset), b) ISIC 2018 (Skin Cancer Dataset)
- Architecture: Segmentor Adversarial Network ( SegAN )
- Evaluation Metrics: a) Dice Score, b) Jaccard Index ( Both of this metrics are commonly used in image segmentation task, which gives the similarity score of the predicted image with the ground truth image.

### Code
